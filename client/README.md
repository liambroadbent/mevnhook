#### So far

I have set up a express server, created an api, and connected it to MongoDB. 

#### Next

I am trying to pull the collection from mongoDB, which i can do. 
Then I want to pull some of the nested properties into a new array and then count them up.

Cant seem to get computed to work. 
I want to sort the payload. 
when vfor over result.payload i can get each payload from the main 

maybe foreach reduce


object 
    5 arrays in it - Payloads 
        3 things in each array 
            1 of those is another object - Payload 
                with 2 arrays in it.
